# Introduction

## Dataset and general idea

-   What we wanted to do and why we chose that dataset
-   What did we intend to analyse in the datasets
-   What was our general goal for the project

# Methods

## Cleaning

-   How we cleaned the data and why

## Description

-   Describing our data
-   Describing the challenges of our data (only one observation per cell line. Few observation in mouse also, as there are only 3 replicates)

## Augmentation

-   How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis
-   Why we did 0 handling and how
-   Why we did log2 fold expressions

# Results

## Mouse gene expression analysis

-   Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
-   0 handling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments

-   Approximately equal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment

-   However, the overlap is very small

## The human Analysis

-   PCA analysis across 18 human cell lines

    Expression Levels vs Compound                                   Expression Levels vs Log2 Fold-Change

# Discussion

-   PCA limitations underscore the complexity of gene regulation and its impact on cell line behavior
-   Future work is needed to better understand melanoma cell's biology (selection of better candidates, compounds)
