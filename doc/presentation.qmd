# Introduction
## Dataset and 

- What we wanted to do and why we chose that dataset

## Purpose of analysis

- Idea for analysis
- hi

# Methods
## Cleaning

- How we cleaned
- We ddi a b and c

## Augmentation

- How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis 
- Relative log2 fold expressions

# Results
## Mouse gene expression analysis
- significantly up and down regulated genes
- volcano plots

  </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Overlaps in regulated genes between treatments
- Significantly regulated genes in each treatment

- The venn diagram shows that there are quite a small overlap
