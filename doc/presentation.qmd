## Introduction

Dataset and general idea - What we wanted to do and why we chose that dataset - What did we intend to analyse in the datasets - What was our general goal for the project

## Methods

### Cleaning

-   How we cleaned the data and why

## Augmentation

-   How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis
-   Why we did 0 handling and how
-   Why we did log2 fold expressions

## Description (1)

-   Many zero expressions through cell lines in each of treatment

## Description (2)

## Results

### Mouse gene expression analysis

-   Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
-   0 handling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments

-   Approximately equal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment

-   However, the overlap is very small

## Discussion
### The Human Analysis

-   PCA analysis across 18 human cell lines

## Discussion

- The BVES gene seems to be the most influenced gene based on our mouse model. The BVES gene plays a role in regeneration processes

-  Our holistic investigation across mouse and human melanoma cell lines provided valuable insights into the influences of the studied compounds and G007.LK effects on their gene expression patterns

-  Though more extensive work is needed to fully understand the impact of the G007.LK in gene expression and cellular pathway across different melanoma cells
