## Introduction

Dataset and general idea - What we wanted to do and why we chose that dataset - What did we intend to analyse in the datasets - What was our general goal for the project

## Methods

### Cleaning

-   How we cleaned the data and why

### Augmentation

-   How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis
-   Why we did 0 handling and how
-   Why we did log2 fold expressions

## Description (1)

-   Many zero expressions through cell lines in each of treatment

## Results

### Mouse gene expression analysis

-   Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
-   0 handling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments

-   Approximately equal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment

-   However, the overlap is very small

## The human Analysis

-   PCA analysis across 18 human cell lines

-   PCA limitations underscore the complexity of gene regulation and its impact on cell line behavior

## Discussion

-   Combined investigation across mouse and human melanoma cell lines provided valuable insights into the influences of the studied compounds and treatment effects on their gene expression patterns

-   Future work is needed to better understand the impact of these treatments on gene expression and cellular pathways across different melanoma cells ( selection of other promising cell candidates and compounds)
