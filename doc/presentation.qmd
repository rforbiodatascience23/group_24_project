## Introduction

-   WNT/β-catenin pathway -\> disregulation in melanoma

-   G007LK -\> decreases WNT/β-catenin signaling

-   Two data sets and two metadata sets (mouse and human)

-   Goal was to identify up and down regulated genes after G007LK treatment

## Methods

### Cleaning

-   How we cleaned the data and why

:::
### Augmentation
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

-   How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis
-   Why we did 0 handling and how
-   Why we did log2 fold expressions

## Description

## Results

### Mouse gene expression analysis
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

-   Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
-   0 handling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

-   Approximately equal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment

-   However, the overlap is very small

## Discussion

### The Human Analysis
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

- PCA.1 The way the cell lines are segregated highlight the biological background outweighs the direct impact of the treatment in regards to gene expression variance

- PCA.2 Outliers like SkMEL28 and A375, along with the distinctive positioning of WM852, suggested unique gene expression profiles potentially associated with the response to G007.LK.

- This limitation in explaining variance by the principal components underscores the complex nature of gene expression changes in the human cell lines.

## Discussion
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}



- In our mouse model, the BVES gene appears to be the most significantly impacted.This gene contributes to regeneration processes

-  This transition between species allowed us to explore cross-species insights in regards to the effect of the G007.LK compound

-  More extensive work is needed to fully understand the impact of the G007.LK in gene expression and cellular pathway across different melanoma cells
