# Introduction
## Dataset and general idea

- What we wanted to do and why we chose that dataset
- What did we intend to analyse in the datasets
- What was our general goal for the project

# Methods
## Cleaning

- How we cleaned the data and why

## Describtion
- Describing our data
- Describing the challenges of our data (only one observation per cell line. Few observation in mouse also, as there are only 3 replicates)


## Augmentation
- How we processed or data to prepare it for analysis
- Why we did 0 handling and how
- Why we did log2 fold expressions


# Results
## Mouse gene expression analysis
- Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
- 0 handeling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments
- Approximately euqal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment
- However, the overlap is very small

## The human Analysis
- PCA
- where is the variance in the df

# Discussion

- What did we learn
- What did we prepare for (the biological analysis people can do with our results)
- Maybe give an example by looking up a single gene or cell line
