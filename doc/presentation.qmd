## Introduction

-   WNT/β-catenin pathway -\> disregulation in melanoma

-   G007LK -\> decreases WNT/β-catenin signaling

-   Two data sets and two metadata sets (mouse and human)

-   Goal was to identify up and down regulated genes after G007LK treatment

## Methods

### Cleaning
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

-   How we cleaned the data and why

```{r, style="max-height: 300px; overflow: auto;"}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false 
zero_replacement <- function(zeroes_removed_df, cols_to_join){
# Replace the zero values in the dataset with a calculated minimum-non-zero value per observation multiplied by 0.65. Thus we ensure that the 0 values that cannot undergo log transformation are replaced by a small non-zero value.
zeroes_replaced_df <- zeroes_removed_df |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(min_non_zero = min(c_across
                            (where
                              (is.numeric))[c_across(where
                                                     (is.numeric)) != 0], na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(across
         (where
           (is.numeric), ~ ifelse(. == 0, 
                                  0.65 * min_non_zero,
                                  .))) |>
  select(-min_non_zero)

#This part calculated the sum across all genes for every observation in the dataset with the replaced zeroes
zeroes_replaced_sums_df <- zeroes_replaced_df |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(total_sum = sum(c_across
                         (everything()),
                         na.rm = TRUE))

n = 1000000 # the data are normalized in TPM that is why we selected 1 million as n

#Data normalization. This part ensures that different experiments with varying total expression levels are brought to consistant scale
scaled_data_df <- zeroes_replaced_sums_df |>
  mutate(scaling_factor = n / total_sum) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(across(-c(total_sum, scaling_factor), ~ . * scaling_factor)) |>
  select(-total_sum, -scaling_factor)

scaled_data_df |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(row_sums = sum(c_across
                        (everything()), 
                        na.rm = TRUE))

#This part of the code binds the normalized and scaled expression data with the first columns from the original df data.
joined_df <- bind_cols(cols_to_join,
                          scaled_data_df)
print(joined_df)
}
```

- Zero replacement 
- log2 fold change

## Results

### Mouse gene expression analysis
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

-   Only 346 significantly regulated genes out of 39075
-   0 handling making estimated treatment impact on expressions unsure.

## Analysis of regulated Mouse genes across the 3 treatments
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

-   Approximately equal amounts of significantly regulated genes in each treatment

-   However, the overlap is very small

## Discussion

### The Human Analysis
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

- PCA.1 The way the cell lines are segregated indicates that the biological background outweighs the direct impact of the treatment in regards to gene expression variance

- PCA.2 Outliers like SkMEL28 and A375, along with the distinctive positioning of WM852, suggested unique gene expression profiles potentially associated with the response to G007.LK.

- This limitation in explaining variance by the principal components underscores the complex nature of gene expression changes in the human cell lines.

## Discussion
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}



- In our mouse model, the BVES gene appears to be the most significantly impacted.This gene contributes to regeneration processes

-  This transition between species allowed us to explore cross-species insights in regards to the effect of the G007.LK compound

-  More extensive work is needed to fully understand the impact of the G007.LK in gene expression and cellular pathway across different melanoma cells
