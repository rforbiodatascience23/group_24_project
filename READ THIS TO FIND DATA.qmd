This is a test file that displays how the 4 data sets look. I don't know if we can find something useful on the supplementary ones, but I included them.

From what I understood, the initial files that we will use with the raw data should be in a folder named data/\_raw, but for now I have the "data" folder in .gitignore.

```{r}
# Link for the studies
# The links to the data set are on the right

# https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-8438?query=G007-LK
# https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-8101
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# human <- read.csv("FIND_OUR_FILES_HERE_BROS/human.gz")
mouse <-read.csv("FIND_OUR_FILES_HERE_BROS/mouse.gz")
mouse_suppl <- read_table("FIND_OUR_FILES_HERE_BROS/mouse_suppl.txt")
human_suppl <- read_table("FIND_OUR_FILES_HERE_BROS/human_suppl.txt")
human <- read.csv("FIND_OUR_FILES_HERE_BROS/human.csv")
```
