## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
mouse_data_backup <- mouse_data

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

library(tidyverse)

# Convert to long format
mouse_data_long <- mouse_data_backup %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(gene_id, symbol), # Exclude gene_id and symbol
    names_to = "treatment_replicate",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# Separate the treatment and replicate information
mouse_data_separated <- mouse_data_long %>%
  separate(
    col = treatment_replicate,
    into = c("treatment", "replicate"),
    sep = "\\." # The separator is a period, escaped because it's a special character in regex
  )

# View the result
head(mouse_data_separated)

```

```{r}
mouse_data_combined <- mouse_data_separated %>%
  mutate(gene_id_symbol = paste(gene_id, symbol, sep = "_")) |>
  select(-gene_id, -symbol)

```

```{r}
mouse_wide<-pivot_wider(mouse_data_combined, names_from = gene_id_symbol)
```

```{}
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{}
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
