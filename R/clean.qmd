Now we need to clean our data First we will check the sructure of the data

```{r}
str(human_raw)

```

Next we will convert the data into tibble

```{r}
human_raw |> 
  as_tibble()
```

First we need to fix the columns names

```{r}

```

We observe that there are many variable in column names, so we need to separate them

```{r}
human_raw|> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !(gene_id:symbol),
    names_to = c("cell_line", "treatment"), 
    names_sep = ".",
    values_to = "expression levels"
  )
```
