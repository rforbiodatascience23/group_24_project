Protocol Description	Three biological replicates of cultured B16-F10 cells, treated with DMSO (0.01%), G007-LK (1 µM), WNT3a (0.5 µg/mL) or G007-LK and WNT3a for 24 hours.	Total RNA was isolated from treated cell lines and tumor samples using GenEluteTM Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma Aldrich).	Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded library prep	Transcripts were quantified with kallisto v0.44 using ensembl transcriptome release 92 (GRCm38). TPM per gene was summarised using sleuth v0.29	HiSeq2500
Protocol Parameters
