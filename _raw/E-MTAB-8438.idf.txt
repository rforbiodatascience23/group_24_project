Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated from treated cell lines and tumor samples using GenEluteTM Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma Aldrich).	Three pooled technical replicates from a panel of 18 human melanoma cell lines treated with DMSO (0.01%) or G007-LK (1 ÂµM) for 24 hours: The cell lines SK-MEL-28, MeWo, and A-375 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD, USA). WM35, WM115, WM1341B, WM1366, WM983B, WM451Lu, WM239A, WM266.4, WM852, WM1382, WM9, WM793B were obtained from the Wistar Institute. LOX-IMVI, FEMX-I and FEMX-V were established at the Norwegian Radium Hospital (Oslo, Norway).	Transcripts were quantified with kallisto v0.44 using ensembl transcriptome release 91 (GRCh38) and TPM per gene was summarised using sleuth v0.29	NextSeq500 v2	Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded library prep
Protocol Parameters
Protocol Hardware				NextSeq 500
Protocol Software			kallisto v0.44, sleuth v0.29
